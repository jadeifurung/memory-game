# Memory Game
Memory game clone built with Vanilla JS.

## How to Play?
* Open this [link](https://jadeifurung.me/memory-game/)
* Click on any card to reveal an image
* Find the image's pair in other cards
    * When you find a match, both cards will stay flipped
    * If you didn't, both of them will face down again
* The game is over when all pairs are found

**Try to find the pairs in as less moves as possible to get a better rate!**
